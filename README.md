# About

This is a [Yinglet](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Out-of-Placers) inspired language add-on for a `b1.7.3` alternate timeline mod by the name of **ReIndev** (by SilverOS.) All this language pack does is simply modify "th" with "zh." Which gives it that special Yinglet flair! That's it. For now.

You can also download this over on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/yinglish-for-reindev) if you prefer that instead!

## Installation

If you already have the game installed, you can simply acess the *languages* button from the main menu, and drag and drop the files in that folder. **No zips required**, you can simply drop them right in as-is. Refresh your menu, and the option should show up under "Yinglish [Val Salvia]" just select it and enjoy!

## Other Info

At the time of writing, there is **no easy or public way to get ReIndev.** You either have to search it up and grab whatever copies various people have and redistubute via *dropbox*, *google drive*, etc... but this is a wild goose chase, and **not reccomended** for more than one reason, but mostly that a lot of versions floating around out there are very outdated. The only way to grab the copy properly is via the **offical Discord server by SilverOS**.

What **I can reccomend** is grabbing [Foxloader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader) by Fox2Code, as this provides a pretty great mod loader, and the offical latest version of ReIndev. It's avalible on Github.

#### Final Notes

You may be wondering why somebody went though all this effort to make such a silly little thing for a very old version of Minecraft. I can only say "why not?" I find it personally facinating how different each Minecraft version and mod (alternate timeline or not) handles languages. Regular Minecraft has Pirate Speak, and a handful of other fun silly languages, why not *Golen Age* Minecraft?
